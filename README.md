# Welcome to Code Quantums Repository!

We are dedicated to being an open source organization and our website is no exception!
We look forward to our first Hackathon with everyone!! âœ¨

# Managing our repository

It is every contributors' responsibility to ensure that a clean working environment is maintained. This allows others to work and utilize to space to better perform and develop on our growing code bases!

## Current Workflows

- `main` deploys to [codequantumutsa.com](http://codequantumutsa.com)
- `develop` deploys to [dev.codequantumutsa.com](http://dev.codequantumutsa.com)

## Submitting a Change

- pushing to `main` is restricted
- make sure you have any recent changes to `develop`
- create a new branch from `develop` and push that new branch
- create a pull request for the new branch into `develop`
- if all approved we will be doing weekly merges into `main`

## Branch Naming

Adding something new: 
```
feature/SHORT_DESCRIPTION_OF_FEATURE_HERE
```

Submitting a bug/error change: 
```
bug/SHORT_DESCRIPTION_OF_BUG_HERE
```
- please note that once your branch is merged it *should* be deleted!
- restrictions have hopefully been placed on the `develop` and `main` branches so that they cannot be deleted!
